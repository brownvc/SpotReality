# SpotReality
Brown University Spot Virtual Reality Project

Pre-requisites:
This project is Windows-only Meta's headsets can only be used with Windows.

To set up this project on your computer:
1. Download Unity if not already installed (https://unity.com/download)
2. In Unity Hub, download version 2022.2.5f1. If you don't see it as an option, you can download 2022.2.5 from the Unity archive (https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive). Before you install in Unity Hub, select "Android Build Support" and its children from the "Platforms" menu.
3. With a git client, navigate to the desired directory and clone this repository ("git clone git@github.com:brownvc/SpotReality.git")
4. Check out the "vrteleop" branch in git.
5. In Unity Hub, select "Open", select the SpotReality folder, and confirm by pressing "open". Make sure Unity opens it with version 2022.2.5f1.
6. Once Unity is open, open the "Spot-PointCloud-ArmControl" scene to see Spot.

Git tracks all Unity assets according to unique IDs. All assets need to be created, moved, or renamed through Unity, so that Unity can manage the IDs and Git can keep track of everything.
