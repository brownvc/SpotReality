# Locomotion System

This object contains the HeightAdjuster component. Originally, this script was only intended to adjust the user's height in the scene, but now it also includes moving around, because the built-in controls for moving around in the scene were buggy. HeightAdjuster supports the following controls:

* Adjust position: moving the left joystick adjusts the user's position in 2D in the scene.
* Adjust rotation: moving the right joystick rotates the user left or right.
* Move higher: pressing down on the right joystick moves the user up.
* Move lower: pressing down on the left joystick moves the user down.
